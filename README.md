Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Varuhn, a spirited 2A computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I'm on a mission to weave together the worlds of hardware and software development to craft solutions that not only simplify but also add that extra dash of awesomeness to our daily lives.

Currently on the lookout for exciting summer 2024 internships, I bring to the table a delightful mix of technical prowess and a sincere dedication to using technology for some serious positive vibes. My passion doesn't stop at embedded systems; I'm also keen on whipping up some magic in the software development realm for applications that make a real impact.

I'm super eager to join innovative teams, dive into real-world scenarios, and let my skills shine. Let's connect and create some tech wonders together! ðŸš€âœ¨
